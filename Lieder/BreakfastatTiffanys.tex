And \[D]I said what about \[A]Breakfast at \[G]Tiffany's, 
she \[D]said I think I re\[A]member that \[G]film and 
as \[D]I recall I think we \[A]both kind of \[G]liked it, 
and \[D]I said: well that's\[A] one thing we've \[G]got. \[D] \[G] \[A]

\beginverse
I ^see you're the ^only ^one who ^knew me 
but ^now your ^eyes see ^through me, 
^I ^guess I ^was wrong. ^ ^

So ^what now it's ^plain to ^see we're ^over 
and I ^hate it when ^things are ^over. 
So ^much is ^left un^done. ^ ^
