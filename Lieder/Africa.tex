\beginverse\memorize
\[A]I hear the drums \[C#m]echoing to\[F#m]night,
\[A]she hears only \[G]whispers of some \[Hm]quiet conver\[F#m]sa\[G]tio\[F#m-Hm]n.
\[A]She's coming \[C#m]in twelve-thirty \[F#m]flight,
the \[A]moonlit wings re\[G]flect the stars, that \[Hm]guide me towards sal\[F#m]va\[G]tio\[F#m-Hm]n.
\[A] I stopped an \[C#m]old man along the \[F#m]way, 
\[A]hoping to find some \[G]old forgotten \[Hm]words or ancient \[F#m]melo\[G]di\[F#-Hm]es.
\[A]He turned to \[C#m]me as if to \[F#m]say, ''Hurry boy, it's \[G]waiting there for \[F#m-Hm]you!''
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Em]It's gonna take a \[C]lot to take me a\[G]way from \[D]you.
\[Em]There's nothing that a \[C]hundred men or \[G]more could ever \[D]do.
\[Em] I bless the \[C]rains down in \[G]Afri\[D]ca,
\[Em]gonna take some \[C]time to do the \[G]things we never \[Hm]ha\[D]a\[Em]ad.

\beginverse
^The wild dogs ^cry out in the ^night,
as ^they grow restless ^longing for some ^solitary ^compan^y. ^
^I know that ^{I must} do what's ^right,
as sure as ^Kilimanjaro ^rises like O^lympus above the ^Serenge^ti. ^
^I seek to ^cure what's deep in^side, 
frightened of this \[G]thing that I've become! \[F#m Hm]
