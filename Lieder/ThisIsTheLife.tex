\beginverse
Oh the \[Am]wind whistles down the \[F]cold dark street tonight,
and the \[C]people they were dancing\[Em] to the music vibe.

And the \[Am]boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair,
while \[F]shy tormented youth sit way over there,
and the \[C]songs get louder each one better than be\[Em]fore.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\lrep And you singing the \[Am]songs thinking this is the life,
and you wake up in the \[F]morning and your head feels twice the size.
Where you gonna go? \[C]Where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep to\[Em]night? \rrep
Where you gonna sleep to\[Am]night
\endchorus

\beginverse
So you're ^heading down the road in your taxi for four,
and you're ^waiting outside Jimmy's front door,
but ^nobody's in and nobody's home till^ four.
So you're ^sitting there with nothing to do,
talking a^bout Robert Riger and his motley crew.
And ^where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep to^night?
