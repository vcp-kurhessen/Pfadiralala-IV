\[C]Just a \[G]small town girl,\[Am] livin' in a \[F]lonely world.

\[C] Just a \[G]city boy,\[Am] born and raised in \[F]south Detroit.
\[C] He took the \[G]midnight train goin' \[Em]any\[F]where.
 \begin{nolyrics} Zwischenspiel: ~ \[C G Am F] \end{nolyrics}
\[C]A singer in a \[G]smokey room,\[Am] a smell of wine and \[F]cheap perfume.

\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]Strangers waiting, \[C]up and down the boulevard.
Their \[F]shadows searching in the \[C]night.
\[F]Streetlights people,\[C] living just to find emotion.
\[F]Hiding, somewhere in the \[G]nig\[C]ht. \[G] \[C] \[F]
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ Working hard to ^get my fill,^ everybody ^want's a thrill.
^ Payin' anything to ^roll the dice, just ^one more ^time.
^ Some will win, ^some will lose.^ Some were born to ^sing the blues.
^ Oh, the movie it ^never ends, it goes ^on and on and ^on and on.
